String: Advanced manipulation
Float16: Comparison.
Thread: Exit code handling.
File: I think, IsEOF is inherently unsafe on Linux.
DynamicLinkLibrary: Error handling for Linux is probably not working.
SystemMessage: Linux implementation for casts is possibly a problem.
Thread: Linux members must possibly be protected by a mutex.
graphics::BeholderDistZoom2D: Class should also be able to change camera parameters (near-clip, far-clip, focal distance).
    Implement Zooming-Speed-Attribute.
BufferedFile: Tiny seeks (e.g. cur-1) should not perform a flush.
Console: Windows implementation for Run. Currently not required as Windows has sufficient API for doing most things, but would be nice to have.
Process: CreateProcessAsUser does not work under Windows
String: Could use more efficient substring search.
File: Access, Reading, Writing, Seeking in Files larger then 2 GB must be tested!!!
Socket: Event for signaling overlapped I/O must be closed in case of a communication error.
